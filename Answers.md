1) Why does LinkedStack not require an explicit constructor?
  
2) What is the time and (extra) space complexity of each of the LinkedStack methods, as well as ReverseLines.main?
  - push
    - Time: O(1)
    - Space: O(1)
  - peek 
    - Time : O(1)
    - Space: O(1)
  - pop
    - Time: O(1)
    - Space: O(1)
  - isEmpty
    - Time: O(1)
    - Space: O(1)
  - asList
    - Time: O(n)
    - Space: O(n)
  - ReverseLines.main 
    - Time: O(n)
    - Space: O(n)
3) How else (not using Node) could we have implemented LinkedStack in such a way that it is still based on a linked list but the asList method uses constant time and space?

4) Is it better for push and pop to return the item or the stack itself? Briefly discuss the pros and cons of each design.
